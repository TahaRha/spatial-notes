# SpaceOS

## Overview

SpaceOS is a proof of concept for a new operating system that leverages spatial configurations to optimize computing performance. This project explores the application of transportation theory, facility location problems, and other advanced mathematical techniques to develop a spatially-aware operating system.

## Objectives

- Investigate optimizations in compute speed and caching by utilizing the spatial attributes of the operating system.
- Explore solutions ranging from simple discrete problems solvable using Linear Programming to more complex problems involving differential geometry and probabilistic methods.

## Research Areas

- **Transportation Theory**: Applying principles of transportation theory to optimize data and resource movement within the system.
- **Facility Location Problems**: Investigating how facility location algorithms can improve system efficiency and reduce redundancy.
- **Differential Geometry**: Utilizing concepts from differential geometry to handle complex spatial configurations and resource-tolling calculations.
- **Probabilistic Methods**: Implementing probabilistic "games" to simplify and enhance resource management and computational efficiency.

## Potential Applications

- **Compute Speed Optimization**: Reducing computation times through efficient spatial data management.
- **Caching and Redundancy Minimization**: Enhancing data caching mechanisms to minimize redundancy and improve access times.
- **Resource Management**: Optimizing resource allocation and usage in distributed systems and networks.
