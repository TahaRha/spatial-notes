# SpaceOS

-Discovering SpaceOS proof of concept, along researching on applying transportation theory, facility location problems, and other to the spatial configuration of a new operating system. 

-I expect to find optimizations in terms of compute speed and caching (redundancy minimization) using the space attribute of this operating system. 

-This could either range from a simple discrete problem solvable using Linear Programming, or to a more complex problem, concerning differential geometry, where a probabilistic "game" could come in to place to simplify resource-tolling calculations usually implemented in differential geometry.
